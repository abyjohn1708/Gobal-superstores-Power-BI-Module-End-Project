# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard---Powerbi
Power BI dashboards can be a helpfull tool to provide insights into sales performance and trends of an organization.
The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by product, sales by location, sales by customer segment, and sales by product category.
It should also provide comparisons of performance to prior years, and allow for drill-down into individual market and products.

# Introduction
A global superstore has given us the task to identify what works best for them in terms of sales and making profit. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) we will help them identify:

1.Their most and least profitable product categories

2.Segment analysis of sales and profit

3.Geographical analysis of sales and profit

4.Performance trend over the years

Given the insights gained from the EDA, the superstore can choose to remove non-profitable products or invest in marketing efforts for products, segments and geographical areas that are driving their profit.
